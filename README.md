Satellite Data Pipeline for Space Agencies
A robust, enterprise-grade data pipeline infrastructure designed to ingest, process, store, and deliver satellite telemetry and Earth observation data at petabyte scale. Built for mission-critical operations supporting space agencies, research institutions, and commercial satellite operators worldwide.

Overview
The Satellite Data Pipeline (SDP) is a comprehensive data management solution engineered to handle the exponential growth of satellite-generated data. Supporting real-time ingestion rates of up to 50 GB/s and storage capacities exceeding 100 petabytes, SDP ensures reliable data processing for Earth observation missions, deep space exploration, and satellite constellation operations.
